            <h3 id="Me" class="scroll-stop">Trail Story</h3>
            <p>My name is <em>Jorge Acosta</em>, and this is an introduction to my journey.</p>
            <p>For a long time, I've always waited for the "right time" to start something. I remember when I was 13 years old, I really wanted to play for FC Dallas DA, which was the highest level of youth soccer at the time. Every day I would check the FC Dallas youth website to see when tryouts were, who to contact, and what it would take. I watched their games on YouTube and told myself, one day I'll be on that team.</p>
            <p>But when the next day came, I wouldn't train. I wouldn't go on a run. Not because I didn't want it, but because I wasn't obsessed with it. I didn't want it as badly as I told myself I did. I kept pushing things off, telling myself I'd start tomorrow. Every now and then I would train, but never consistently enough to actually take myself to the next level.</p>
            <p>Looking back, that mindset didn't stop there. It followed me into other parts of my life. Whether it was asking a girl out, starting a business idea, or taking a risk on something new, I kept waiting for the perfect moment.</p>
            <p>At some point, I realized how short life really is. Even at 20 years old, it started to feel like I was wasting time. I got tired of hearing excuses—from myself, from friends, from family. Life doesn't pause or wait for anyone to feel ready, and it definitely wasn't going to wait for me.</p>

            <h3 id="Identity" class="scroll-stop" >Identity</h3>

            <p>This past summer the idea came to me to be spontaneous and adventurous. I wanted to be the friend you see on TikTok and Snapchat, going on the most chaotic adventures. Which got me thinking, is it because I want to do it for myself or to show other people what I'm doing? Well, it's both. I want to explore my journey with the world, to show people who they can become through me.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>I don't really have it all figured out. I'm just trying things, learning along the way, and doing more instead of sitting around thinking about it. I want people to see my journey and feel like they can do it too, even if they don't know exactly where they're headed.</p>

            <p>What's up and coming for me is getting out there more. My first destination will be Oregon on my birthday a couple months from now.</p>

            <p>This summer is about getting back to the things I love and trying new ones: surfing again, rock climbing, and maybe even skydiving (still scares me, so we'll see).</p>
            <p>I also want to hit more soccer games, especially in Europe and South America, and feel the sport where it means everything to people. No strict plan just keep moving.</p>
