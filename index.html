            <h3 id="Me">About me</h3>
            <p> My name is <em>Jorge Acosta</em>. I'm Mexican American, born here in <strong>Dallas, Texas,</strong> and
                my first love was soccer.
                What got me into tech and computers was when I was around 7/8 years old, back in 2012. My parents had a
                computer, and I would come home and play Cool Math Games, explore how the computer worked, and it really
                fascinated me. That was all I knew until one day my parents got rid of it, and from then on I didn't
                have access to one. Fast forward through the rest of my childhood, I kept playing soccer. I did the
                whole nine yards got trainers, played at the highest level here in the U.S., and enjoyed it up until my
                sophomore year of high school, when I started losing interest. Soccer had been all I'd ever known, but
                around that time, a friend introduced me to computer science. That sparked an old memory of how much I
                loved being on the computer as a kid. The following semester, I signed up for a computer science class,
                and it felt like my calling. I felt so good being in that class. From there, I continued learning. I
                picked up Java and would go home to watch videos about what it means to be a programmer. The fact that
                it was also a good paying career made it even more exciting, even though the job market later got tough.
                Still, I've stayed motivated to chase something I find interest in.</p>

            <p> By senior year, I was still playing soccer now at the second highest level in Dallas, trying to earn a
                scholarship so I could study computer science. Unfortunately, soccer scholarships are tough to come by
                compared to other sports. While there are strong D1 programs across the country, Texas only has three,
                with just one in Dallas. That makes it difficult to go to a good academic school and also play soccer,
                because big schools like UT, Texas Tech, Texas A&M, and many others don't even have men's soccer
                programs. So even though they're great schools, the opportunity just isn't there for soccer players. I
                did receive a couple of D2 and D3 offers, but they were either 10 hours away or at schools that weren't
                what I wanted academically. So I stayed in Dallas and decided to play juco ball at Cedar Valley. A
                friend recruited me, along with a few old teammates, to try and take down Richland, which is basically
                the Alabama of juco soccer. About six or seven of us joined, and we started playing really well. The
                only weak spot was our goalkeeper not to throw him under the bus, but almost anything on target would go
                in.</p>

            <p> Still, the season was going strong, and then came the big game us, ranked #2, against Richland ranked
                #1.
                Everything was going well until the worst moment of my life I tore my ACL, MCL, and meniscus. Just like
                that, I was out for the game and out for the season. I'm not saying we would've because of me, but for
                the first time in history, we only lost to them 1-0, and I believe it would've been different if I had
                been on the field because we were 0-0 up until I had gone down. Five days later, I had surgery, and I
                was sidelined for nine months. My knee has never been the same since, but during that recovery time, I
                learned a side hustle called Amazon FBA where I would resell items, and I also studied more about
                programming, including the origins of computer science and languages and why we use them. From there on
                I was able to fully devout my time to becoming a progammar and has led me to here.</p>

            <h3 id="Identity">Identity</h3>

            <p>
                When I think about my future as a developer, the first thing that comes to mind is freedom.
                I'm not chasing a specific title or job description as much as I'm chasing a lifestyle.
                I want the flexibility to work remotely, the ability to support myself from anywhere, and
                the chance to travel without having to pause my career. These last couple of months have
                opened my eyes to the kind of person I want to be in the future. I kept thinking about how
                I was going to plan out my life, but the truth is no one really has it all figured out, so
                I'd rather focus on living in the present. I want to explore now, not wait until later,
                because experiences today will shape the person and developer I become tomorrow. If I'm not
                in class on a Thursday's it might be because I decided to go surf, and that freedom to choose
                is exactly what I want my developer identity to represent.
            </p>

            </figure>


            <p>
                My developer identity is shaped around adaptability. I don't want to be locked into one
                narrow path I'd rather be someone who can learn new tools, switch between projects, and
                solve problems no matter where I'm working from. The idea of being able to contribute to
                real projects while sitting in a café in another city, or on the road, is exactly what
                excites me about this career. One year I could be building webpages for a couple of small
                businesses, the next I could be making an AI, or even creating my own prediction model to
                help me choose the right moneylines so I can gamble on the Cowboys. That's what makes me
                want to get up and achieve my goals knowing I'm not defined by waking up every day and
                doing the same thing over and over.

            <h3 id="Learning">Learning Journey</h3>

            <p> What I'm hoping to gain from this course is to touch up on my HTML and CSS programming. I've taken
                online courses on Codecademy and YouTube, where I would practice just for fun and try to learn. It's
                been about two years since I last worked with it, so I don't remember everything, but as the class moves
                forward, I know it'll come back to me. I'll probably have those “ah yes, I know this.” moments. I don't
                know exactly what I want to go into since there are so many fields in software development. In the sense
                of HTML and CSS, I wouldn't say it's easy, but it definitely isn't as frustrating as Python or Java.
                With those, I would often get angry because I didn't know why my code wasn't running properly or
                sometimes why it was working but the code I had written wouldn't make sense Nonetheless, I think I'm
                more of a back end guy or someone who enjoy start up projects. For example, I recently met a guy on
                TikTok who had offers from Amazon, but he was really into crypto. He built a project and posted it on
                Twitter, where a recruiter saw it and offered him a job at Gemini to build crypto tools. That really
                intrigued me, because he created something unique in a niche he was passionate about, and it turned into
                a career opportunity.</p>

            <p> My niche might be that I used to be an Amazon seller. If you didn't know, Amazon is kind of like eBay in
                the sense that most of the products are sold by third party sellers. That's why, during Amazon Day or
                Black friday, when prices went up, people thought Amazon itself was raising prices, but in reality it
                was the third party sellers. I never did that type of price gouging for the record. I sold on Amazon for
                about 6/7 months, and I got pretty good at it. The challenge that I ran into was needing at least
                $10,000 to start making good money. When I started, I had just torn my ACL and was bedridden. After two
                months of recovery, I was finally able to walk and drive again, but during that time I became good at
                finding products to sell. I sold everything from Gorilla Tape to Harry's bar soap. Some of the profit
                margins were insane, for example, I'd sell a pack of four soaps for $25, and my return would be about
                $18. I made a decent amount of money, but I was limited because I only had $1/2k to work with. On top of
                that, Amazon would withhold payments, and I had monthly expenses like software subscriptions $200/300
                and a virtual assistant. So while I was making profit, a lot of it was canceled out by costs.</p>

            <p>Now, I'm determined to build my own software tools. Selling on Amazon requires 4/5 different programs,
                and those subscription fees add up quickly. If I can build my own tools, I could save myself a ton of
                money and reinvest more into products. On top of that, I've noticed many of the existing tools have
                clunky, unattractive interfaces. I want to create something that's easier to use and more efficient. And
                since people already pay $50/70 a month for one piece of software, I could charge $30/40 for my own and
                still provide a better experience. That way, not only would I be saving money by using my own tools, but
                I could also make money by offering them to others. That's my journey and why I want to become a
                software developer. </p>
